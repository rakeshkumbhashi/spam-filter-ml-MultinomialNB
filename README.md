# spam-filter-ml-MultinomialNB
Spam filter on Spam Public assassin (Apache) using Python, NLTK PorterStemmer and Multinomial Naive Bayes

Interestingly the results show that using Stemming did not improve the prediction metrics - detailed metrics in Results.txt file

Please note I had to downgrade and use 3.2.1 version of NLTK as 3.2.2 would throw an indexing error and followed advice on StackOverflow
Python version used is 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.10
